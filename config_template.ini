[sources]
# Specify source names and the path (absolute or relative) to the corresponding csv in this section. Add a section for
# that source below by the same name you put here. Fill out values for target_column(s), header_row_num, & ignored_rows.
# Ex:
# source_name = /path/to/csv

# [source_name]
# target_column(s) =
# header_row_num =
# ignored_rows =
# match_by = (works similar to before but now there should be more options, multiple matches)

# defaults do not apply to sections below here

[source_rules]
# what is valid for what source and what is missing from some sources that appear in others?

[field_rules]
# Field validation:
# This section is entirely optional.
#
# Enter field names (headers) and then on the other side of the equal sign put a regular expression for data to be
# validated by. Do not wrap your regular expression in /. Data in the column of the given header that does not match the
# given regular expression will not be transferred.
# Ex:
# IPv4 address = ^(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$
