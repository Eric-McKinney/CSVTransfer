# CSVTransfer
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to enable the transfer of large amounts of 
data from one csv to another. Specifically, any number of columns can be
chosen to be moved, but just as many columns need to be chosen to be the
destination of the data. The transfer is done according to another column
from each file to "match by" so that data can be associated with other data.
